# Skill Mastery calculator

## Overview

The Skill Mastery Calculator is a web application that helps you estimate the time it will take to master a new skill.

 Based on the "10,000-Hour Rule," this calculator allows you to 
 - input the number of hours you plan to practice each day
 - calculates the total time required to reach 10,000 hours of dedicated practice.

You can also customize various lifestyle factors to get a more realistic estimate of your available practice hours, such as :
- sleep
- meals
- travel time 

 The calculator provides a clear breakdown of the time to mastery in years, months, and days.
